\# Cybersecurity Disclosure Timing and Market Reactions: An Empirical Analysis of Information Asymmetry in Communications Companies



\## 1. Scientific Method Framework



\### Research Question

\*\*How does cybersecurity disclosure timing affect market reactions in communications companies, and does firm governance quality moderate this relationship?\*\*



This research question is:

\- \*\*Specific\*\*: Focuses on cybersecurity disclosure timing in communications sector

\- \*\*Measurable\*\*: Uses quantifiable market reaction metrics (cumulative abnormal returns)

\- \*\*Relevant\*\*: Addresses critical policy questions about mandatory vs. voluntary disclosure

\- \*\*Time-bound\*\*: Achievable within course timeline using existing datasets



\### Hypothesis

\*\*H1\*\*: Immediate cybersecurity disclosure results in more negative short-term market reactions compared to delayed disclosure due to signaling effects, but this penalty is moderated by firm governance quality.



\*\*Testable Predictions\*\*:

\- β₁ < 0: Immediate disclosure associated with more negative market reactions

\- β₂ > 0: Higher governance quality associated with better market reactions

\- β₃ > 0: Governance quality moderates the disclosure timing penalty



\*\*Falsifiable Conditions\*\*: The hypothesis would be rejected if immediate disclosure shows positive market reactions or if governance quality does not moderate the relationship.



\## 2. Problem Definition and Business Relevance



\### Problem Statement

Current regulatory frameworks require varying disclosure timelines for cybersecurity incidents, but lack empirical foundation for optimal timing. The SEC's recent cybersecurity disclosure rules highlight the need for evidence-based policy recommendations.



\### Theoretical Foundation

This research extends the Myers-Majluf (1984) information asymmetry framework to cybersecurity contexts. While original work focused on capital structure decisions, we adapt it to disclosure timing in multi-stakeholder environments.



\*\*Key Innovation\*\*: Incorporating governance quality as a moderator of information asymmetry effects in cybersecurity disclosure decisions.



\### Business Impact

\- \*\*Regulatory Policy\*\*: Inform SEC disclosure timing requirements

\- \*\*Corporate Strategy\*\*: Guide firms' disclosure optimization strategies

\- \*\*Investor Relations\*\*: Improve market efficiency in cybersecurity risk pricing
